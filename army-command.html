                Commanding your bullet army is the heart of Bullet Army Run.
                After dozens of hours leading armies and experimenting with
                tactics, I've uncovered some essential tips for new and
                experienced commanders alike:<br /><br />
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Always collect extra bullets before attempting dangerous
                    obstacle sections.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Look ahead to spot the safest landing spots and avoid deadly
                    traps.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use strategic positioning to access bonus bullets that can
                    expand your army.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Practice timing to navigate obstacles precisely and avoid
                    army losses.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Master these techniques, and you'll be unstoppable on your way
                to becoming the ultimate army commander!
